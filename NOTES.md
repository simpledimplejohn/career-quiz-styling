OUTCOMES:

A SOCIAL
You might have described yourself as simply a "people person" in the past, but there are many layers to your personality beyond just being friendly. You are wise, dynamic, and have a deep understanding of psychology and the human experience. You have emotional intelligence and can interpret subtle nuances in people’s communication that other people might not even notice.

You understand that being good with people is all about communication. You’re incredibly empathetic. You have great communication skills and can problem solve through listening, speaking, or writing. When you speak, you deliver information in crystal clear language. You're observant of people's behaviors and naturally understand how to support their ability to resolve problems or develop to their full potential. 

You have high emotional IQ – the ability to understand and manage your emotions so you can empathize with other people and notice complex social cues that signal the need to problem solve effectively. You're good at understanding issues from other people's point of view and can adjust to situations in order to resolve situations that are stressful or challenging. 

Not every social person enjoys working directly face-to-face with people every day, but even if you’re an introvert, you understand the psychology of how people make choices, build relationships, and engage with each other. Even if you prefer to work alone, you like observing people and working on projects that relate to communication or the human experience. You have the ability to understand perspectives that are different from your own and this allows you to understand how to work toward a resolution on larger social problems, customer issues, or know how people might interact with technology.

You understand that people are complex, fascinating beings and your people and communication skills are highly developed and multifaceted. Don't let anyone downplay these as "soft skills" or "people skills." You have the ability to navigate the most complex system in the universe and can simultaneously comprehend and problem solve the elaborate algorithms of human interaction.
Don't believe the stereotypes about social people only being suited to client-facing roles – it’s actually the opposite. You’re suited for any career path because almost every profession has a social element to it. For example, software engineering is a job that requires creating software for humans to use, so it's important to know how to write code that will translate to a better experience for the people using it on the other end.
Although the stereotypical professions for people who score high in the social personality type are jobs like psychologist, social worker, or teacher, you are not limited to those career paths. As a social person, you can do anything, but it has to be through the perspective of human experience. For example, the tech industry might not seem like a place for social people to flourish, but it’s actual the opposite. Because technology is mostly created for people to use, it is a very human-focused profession. It’s a misconception that career paths like software engineering are anti-social when they’re very collaborative by nature (people often share code with each other on teams and help each other problem solve). Also, the problems in technology are often understanding psychology of human behavior and how people interact with computers. This is just an example of one industry, but it’s important to think outside of the stereotypes and look at how your personality can fit with different career paths.

Another aspect of the social personality that is often overlooked is the potential for growth into leadership. Many social people have natural leadership skills that can evolve as they gain more experience in their careers. It’s a misconception that a focus on collaboration is not a leadership skill. Good leaders are empathetic and tuned in to group decision making. If you’re a social person it might be good to consider growing into a leadership role over time (but only if you want to – you’re in charge of your career!)

B ORGANIZED
You have a talent for organization and planning, and you like the world around you to be streamlined, efficient, and easy to navigate. You care about quality and like to plan things out in advance to avoid unnecessary problems, delays, confusion, and miscommunication. You like systems and processes because they create structure and provide a step-by-step approach to getting things accomplished and improved. You know that the world is a chaotic and complex place, so you prefer to make it simple and easy to understand by identifying the destination of a project and outlining a roadmap to provide a clear direction on how to get there. You enjoy using these roadmaps to organize task in front of you as well as communication with other people to show them how to navigate complex challenges. 

You like to plan for the future. You enjoy the process of thinking and envisioning how things could be better and planning out all the steps that need to happen day-to-day to move forward toward accomplishing little tasks and eventually completing bigger projects. It’s fun for you to think about the bigger picture and then break it down into smaller steps to create milestones that can help motivate you toward a larger goal. You have a keen eye for details and can detect when something is wrong to anticipate small problems that impact the overall final outcome.

There are different types of organized people and not everyone is considered tidy or clean. Some people like the chaos of being in the mix of a messy problem and sorting it out. Other people don’t like disorder and prefer to work only in systems that are already organized and spend their energy working to improve them and make them even better. Some organized people have a talent for detecting details and enjoy finding errors, discovering mistakes, and correcting them by making small adjustments — but not every organized person likes this type of work — some prefer to resolve bigger, messier problems. In fact, some organized people have a messy workspace but have everything organized in their head. Some organized people like to create structures from scratch and build systems where none existed before. Other organized people prefer to have these processes already in place so they can work focus on improving it rather than building something new.

As an organized person, you see the world through the perspective of structure and can provide tools, schedules, and information tracking to help people work better, communicate more effectively, and have less stress when working toward a goal. To an organized person, the future can seem less overwhelming because you can focus on a calendar to understand and communicate how to accomplish bigger tasks by arranging activities on specific dates to make sure everything is finished on time. A plan and a to-do list can help you make sense of complex projects. You understand how to use the right tools to organize information, timelines, or break complex problems down into systems that create easier solutions and less stress.

As an organized person, you are a blessing to any workplace because you have solutions that help everyone work better, communicate more effectively, and relax more. You can work in a variety of different professions but need to be in a position that allows you to make changes and improvements in the systems and processes around you. Depending on the specifics of your personality, you might either want to work in a career path that allows you to create a structure from scratch or one where that structure already exists.

The most obvious career paths for organizers are project manager, operations manager, or professional organizer, but everyone is different, and you can approach organizing careers from a variety of perspectives. You might be highly detail-oriented and be great at catching errors so a career path as a proofreader would be an ideal match for your strengths. On the other hand, you might be great at organized chaos and love the excitement of being an event planner. As an organized person, you could work in any industry. Combining these talents with other areas of interest can help you understand the right match for your career.

C INVESTIGATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING
You are inherently curious and like to understand the complexities of the world around you. Problem solving is your favorite work-related activity, and you enjoy understanding how things operate, digging into the details, and putting together the puzzle to understand how to resolve issues. You like investigating through research, asking questions, reading, looking at data, or gathering information from a variety of sources to discover answers — and possibly more questions. Your goal might be to improve things or finish a project, but you’re not always interested in the final outcome and may be satisfied coming up with more problems than when you started. You enjoy investigating to get to the heart of an issue and fixing the root cause of a problem rather than finding a shallow quick-fix solution. You’re very curious and determined   — you will keep asking questions, researching, and investigating until you find solutions that improve processes and ensure quality.

You might be someone who reads every review of a product before you buy it. You might prefer to read more about an issue before forming an opinion on it. Or you might need to think or research a problem before providing a solution to people. For some people that means that you’re quiet because you think first before responding, but for other people, it means you like to talk and think through solutions verbally. You love to learn new information and are attracted to complex situations that require you to think deeper, pay attention to layers of information, and investigate more details to discover different perspectives on a situation. You’re drawn to entertainment that makes you think deeply like complex movie plots with mysterious endings or podcasts that provide unique perspectives and give you insight into complicated issues.

You like to think, learn, and process information in a pragmatic and logical way based on data and research. You enjoy using technical tools to gather information and would enjoy creating reports to communicate this information to other people. You’re good at seeing patterns and synthesizing information. You focus on quality and good design or engineering that makes things work effectively. You’d rather spend more time on something to make it quality than finish something quicky. You understand the importance of solving problems at the root of the issue and spending time to understand all the information available to create a process or system that has a long-term and permanent solution. 

A small percentage of my clients with this personality type consider themselves more curious than other people to the point where they can be disruptive. They describe being the person who always has a lot of questions during meetings and can’t proceed with a project before understanding all of the details. They have to read through all of the legal documents, policies, and procedures before moving forward to the next step and can pick out details to identify problems that need to be examined first before agreeing that something is complete. This can cause conflict in the workplace if leadership or people on a team want to move forward quickly, but this type of personality can also be praised for identifying risks or saving time and money by preventing bigger long-term issues. 

There are different types of investigative problem-solving people. Some love researching by reading long, complex documents and others prefer to gather information from a variety of scattered sources and then bring the data all together. Some people with this personality type love data and numbers but others prefer to have conversations and understand more qualitative information. You might consider yourself scientific, mathematical, technical — or even nerdy, but you might not. With this personality type, you could be a dreamer, a social butterfly, or not identify with logic at all — you might simply enjoy research, thinking, and understanding the world.

The stereotype of an Investigative Problem-Solving personality type is an engineer or scientist, but you may or may not identify with these career paths. You can work in any career path as long as it gives you the opportunity to understand problems from a more complex perspective and spend time researching, asking questions, and diving into the details to understand bigger solutions before moving forward with decisions. You get bored easily, so you need a career path that allows you continuous learning and professional growth opportunities. You need time in your workday to understand longer-term projects, examine the bigger picture, and look through the details. You prefer not to be pushed to make decisions quickly based on shallow knowledge of a project.

D CREATIVE PROBLEM-SOLVING
You are a creative thinker who likes to come up with new ideas, learn about innovative ways of doing things, and look at the world from unique perspectives to keep things interesting. You are bored easily with conventional ways of doing things and are constantly craving new challenges. You don’t like routine unless the purpose is to create something new or work on the details of a bigger creative picture.

You might not consider yourself talented artistically, but you enjoy being around creativity, colors, or new adventures. Not every Creative Problem-Solving personality type has to be hands-on creative, but you definitely enjoy thinking about designing or building something new or being a part of this process. You like coming up with new concepts, brainstorming, ideating, and creating. You can see a vision for something different and imagine outcomes that other people might not see or believe are possible. You can simultaneously see the small details and the big picture—and synthesize this information into a clear vision.

Creativity is all about expression—whether that means writing, art, or communicating with people about ideas. You like to be in an environment that allows you to feel authentic and that gives you the freedom to voice your thoughts and opinions openly. You get energized by having the creative space to develop new ideas—whether it’s through collaboration or independent thought and imagination. You’re good at using your intuition to come up with ideas and new ways of thinking about things. Ideas often come to you randomly out of the blue and you sometimes have spontaneous bursts of inspiration that don’t fit into a logical structure of a work environment.

People can be intimidated by the concept of creativity because it’s often associated with artistic talent. Just because you think from a creative perspective, doesn’t mean you must have an artistic craft. Having the Creative Problem-Solving personality type just means that you enjoy freedom, big picture thinking, and self-expression in your career. You tend to get bored easily, so you need a career path that is creatively stimulating and full of continuous learning, professional growth opportunities, and the ability to think from different perspectives. You like understanding complex issues and having the time to work through solutions that address all of the problems through complex and interesting solutions.

E DRIVEN
You are a hard worker and like to see results from the effort that you put forth on projects. You have very high standards for your achievements and push yourself to do the best that you possibly can at everything you do. These high standards often make it so that you don’t always see how incredibly accomplished, intelligent, and creative you actually are because you’re too busy focusing on improving upon what you’ve already done. 

You like a challenge and don’t mind pushing yourself to achieve even greater accomplishments. You like to take things to the next level and see how much success you can achieve. Each project or situation is a new chance for you to boost your confidence and prove to yourself that you can push yourself to a new level. You can be a risk taker, but sometimes you don’t like starting over with new things because it takes longer for you to be good at them. However, you don’t mind trying something new if it presents a new opportunity for you to learn, grow, and reach the next level of success. You like to be successful at everything you do and enjoy projects that provide you with clear opportunities to measure achievements so you can see real results. Ambiguous and confusing expectations make you less motivated, and you prefer to keep score on your success and celebrate when you’ve gone above and beyond. 

You’re self-motivated and have an entrepreneurial spirt that keeps you focused on the success of a project because you’re not satisfied with the status quo and will push for improvements and innovation. You have a natural curiosity for the world and passion for launching new projects that keep you motivated, driven, and energized for work projects. However, you can also get bored easily, so it’s important to continue to have new challenges and learning opportunities in front of you to keep motivated and interested.

It can be confusing for the Driven personality type on whether they should be leaders or entrepreneurs because their ambition and drive to succeed is sometimes (but not always) combined with a desire to manage, lead projects, or start a business. You might feel excited to be successful at projects but may or may not want to take on a leadership role. Sometimes leadership is a natural next step in this personality type but other times you’d rather move forward and accomplish goals as an individual contributor. Similarly, you might have fantasies of starting your own business (and would probably be great at it) but sometimes it seems nice to not have the responsibility of the entire company. Either way, you have a strong work ethic and the potential to achieve great success in your work.

F LEADERSHIP
You are a big-picture thinker who has the ability to visualize the future to direct people forward. You understand strategically how things should be done well and can anticipate what steps need to be taken in order to be successful. You like to voice your opinions for making big, important decisions and like to be in charge of strategy to make sure your ideas are fully realized.

Even if you haven’t had leadership experience, you may find yourself craving this role, so you come up with big ideas, as well as direct and influence decision making to turn your ideas into successful projects. The idea of leadership can feel intimidating to some, but there are many different types of leaders and a variety of different leadership styles. You can discover your personal leadership style by thinking about how much responsibility you want to take on and what types of projects are exciting to you. Think of leaders that you admire and pay attention to what inspires you about their personalities in order to express your own way of leading in the world.

There are two types of leaders: experts and managers. Experts are leaders who prefer to focus on knowledge, skills, and passions but don’t want the responsibility of managing a team. Thought leadership is the focus for experts, who prefer to have subjects that they’re knowledgeable about and can guide the decision-making process for projects from beginning to end without directly managing. In fact, some experts have very little interaction with people and can lead through presentations, writing, or reports without managing a team. Managers, on the other hand, are people leaders. They enjoy working with teams to motivate, mentor, and provide feedback on areas of improvement and growth. Managers like guiding projects through direct communication with employees and find fulfillment leading teams of people through a process to ensure success. You may identify somewhere on the spectrum between these types of leaders.

Whether you’re currently a leader in your career or just recognize leadership qualities in your personality, it’s going to be important for you to explore opportunities to grow in leadership within your career in the future. Fortunately, there is no end to growth, education, and advancement when it comes to leadership, so you have a lifetime of opportunities for learning and self-development in the future. Every career path has the opportunity for growth as a leader, including entrepreneurship, so you will have unlimited potential for career advancement.
